It is a landing page for a agriculture startup. Hosted on a RPI at my house. Unfortunately, could not go forward with it.

It promotes organic farming, has tutorials, however, the goal was to connect small people starting in backyard production to local buyers.

Organic farming maintains and improve fertility, soil structure and biodiversity, and reduce erosion. It reduces the risks of human, animal, and environmental exposure to toxic materials. Its fine-tune farming practices meet local production conditions and satisfy local markets.
